// Release-specific Firebase settings
// You can override any settings from the base config here if needed for release builds

// For production builds, you might want to use different analytics settings:
// FIREBASE_IS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED = true

// Or ensure debug logging is disabled:
// FIREBASE_DEBUG_LOGGING = false

// The release configuration inherits all settings from Firebase.xcconfig
// This includes all the Firebase secrets and common settings
